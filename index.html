            <p>Bungee jumping is an exhilarating activity where individuals leap from a significant height while securely connected to a resilient elastic cord. This jump is typically initiated from a tall structure like a building, crane, bridge spanning a deep ravine, or a natural geographic feature such as a cliff. It is even possible to bungy jump from certain aircraft that can hover above the ground, such as a hot-air balloon or helicopter. The excitement of the experience arises from the sensation of free-falling and the subsequent rebound. As the person jumps, the cord elongates, causing the jumper to ascend once again as the cord recoils, creating an oscillating motion that continues until all the kinetic energy is dissipated</p>
            <p>Since bungee jumping involves diving headfirst and experiencing significant movement upon landing, it is strongly advised to avoid eating immediately before the activity. It is especially crucial to refrain from consuming a heavy meal beforehand to prevent the unpleasant occurrence of vomiting while airborne. While bungee jumping is possible throughout the year, it's important to note that certain weather conditions like fog or snow can significantly affect the overall enjoyment of the experience. That's why the summer season is often regarded as the ideal time for bungee jumping, as the weather tends to be warm and dry, ensuring optimal conditions for this exhilarating activity.</p>
